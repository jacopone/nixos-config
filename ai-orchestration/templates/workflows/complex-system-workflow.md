# Complex System Workflow: {FEATURE_NAME}

**Estimated Duration**: 1-4 weeks  
**Complexity**: High  
**Team Size**: 3-4 agents + human oversight  

## Workflow Overview

This template handles complex system features requiring extensive planning, coordination, and multiple integration points.

### Prerequisites
- [ ] Comprehensive requirements analysis
- [ ] Architecture design review
- [ ] Resource allocation confirmed
- [ ] CCPM structure with full context management

### Phase 1: Strategic Planning (2-3 days)
**Lead**: Claude Code with stakeholder input

#### Requirements Analysis
- [ ] Detailed PRD creation
- [ ] Stakeholder interviews
- [ ] Technical feasibility study
- [ ] Risk assessment

#### Architecture Design
- [ ] System architecture diagrams
- [ ] Database design
- [ ] API contract specifications
- [ ] Security requirements

#### Project Setup
- [ ] Epic decomposition (5-15 GitHub Issues)
- [ ] Agent role assignments
- [ ] Context structure setup
- [ ] Communication protocols

### Phase 2: Foundation Development (1-2 weeks)
**Parallel execution with coordination checkpoints**

#### Backend Infrastructure (Cursor)
- [ ] Database schema and migrations
- [ ] Core API framework
- [ ] Authentication/authorization
- [ ] Logging and monitoring setup
- [ ] Unit testing framework

#### Frontend Architecture (v0.dev)
- [ ] Component library foundation
- [ ] State management setup
- [ ] Routing and navigation
- [ ] Design system implementation
- [ ] Testing framework setup

#### Integration Planning (Claude Code)
- [ ] API integration specifications
- [ ] Data flow documentation
- [ ] Error handling strategies
- [ ] Performance requirements

### Phase 3: Feature Implementation (1-2 weeks)
**Coordinated parallel development**

#### Backend Services (Cursor)
- [ ] Business logic implementation
- [ ] Advanced API endpoints
- [ ] Data processing services
- [ ] Background job processing
- [ ] Performance optimization

#### Frontend Features (v0.dev)

- [ ] Advanced user interactions
- [ ] Real-time features
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Accessibility implementation

#### Continuous Integration (Claude Code)
- [ ] API integration testing
- [ ] Cross-component coordination
- [ ] Progress synchronization
- [ ] Issue resolution

### Phase 4: System Integration (3-5 days)
**Full system coordination**

#### Integration Testing (Gemini Pro)
- [ ] End-to-end workflow testing
- [ ] Performance testing under load
- [ ] Security penetration testing
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility

#### System Optimization (Claude Code)
- [ ] Performance profiling
- [ ] Security hardening
- [ ] Documentation completion
- [ ] Deployment preparation

### Phase 5: Deployment & Monitoring (1-2 days)
**Production readiness**

#### Deployment (Claude Code)
- [ ] Staging environment testing
- [ ] Production deployment
- [ ] Monitoring setup
- [ ] Rollback procedures

#### Validation (Gemini Pro)
- [ ] Production testing
- [ ] Performance monitoring
- [ ] Error tracking
- [ ] User feedback integration

## Coordination Protocols

### Daily Sync (15 minutes)
- Progress updates from each agent
- Blocking issues identification
- Next 24-hour planning

### Weekly Review (1 hour)
- Architecture decisions review
- Integration testing results
- Timeline and scope adjustments

### Milestone Gates
1. **Architecture Approval**: Before Phase 2
2. **Foundation Review**: Before Phase 3
3. **Integration Checkpoint**: Before Phase 4
4. **Production Readiness**: Before Phase 5

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks
- **Integration Complexity**: Daily coordination calls
- **Performance Issues**: Early performance testing
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Security review at each phase

### Process Risks
- **Scope Creep**: Weekly scope reviews
- **Communication Gaps**: Structured context updates
- **Timeline Pressure**: Milestone-based planning
