## Getting Started: Real-World Implementation

### Example: Gherkin User Story Workflow

**Sample User Story:**
```gherkin
Feature: Enhanced Task Assignment Dashboard
  As a project manager
  I want to assign tasks with priority levels and dependencies
  So that team members can see their workload and work efficiently

Scenario: Create task with dependencies
  Given I am logged in as a project manager
  When I create a new task with high priority
  And I set dependencies on 2 existing tasks
  Then the system should validate dependencies
  And notify assigned team members
  And update the dashboard in real-time
```

### Step-by-Step Platform Implementation
