# Claude Code Awareness Enhancement Plan

**Date**: 2025-10-07
**Status**: Research complete, Implementation roadmap created
**Location**: `~/claude-nixos-automation/COMPREHENSIVE_AUTOMATION_ROADMAP.md`

---

## 🎯 Summary

Based on extensive research of Claude Code best practices (2025), we've designed a comprehensive automation system that will make your NixOS setup the **most context-aware AI development system possible**.

### Current State (Good ✅)
- System-wide CLAUDE.md with 122 tools
- Project-level CLAUDE.md with workflows
- Auto-update on every rebuild
- Zero-drift architecture

### Target State (Excellent 🌟)
- **8/8 best practices areas covered** (currently 2/8)
- **40% token reduction** via usage optimization
- **100% automated maintenance** across all areas
- **Context quality** measurably improved

## 📊 Research Findings

### Best Practices Identified

Based on research from:
- ✅ Anthropic official Claude Code best practices
- ✅ ClaudeLog community documentation
- ✅ Builder.io production usage guide
- ✅ 20+ hours of community patterns

**Key findings:**

1. **Hierarchical CLAUDE.md** - Directory-level files (highest priority)
2. **Local project memory** - Machine-specific context (.gitignored)
3. **Custom slash commands** - Workflow automation (`~/.claude/commands/`)
4. **MCP expansion** - Auto-configure based on project type
5. **Content optimization** - Periodic refactoring to stay concise
6. **Usage analytics** - Prioritize frequently-used tools
7. **Runtime introspection** - Live system state (not just static config)
8. **Sub-agents for complexity** - Better context preservation

**Gap analysis:**
- ✅ System-wide CLAUDE.md (have)
- ✅ Project-level CLAUDE.md (have)
- ❌ Directory-level CLAUDE.md (missing)
- ❌ Local context files (missing)
- ❌ Custom slash commands (missing)
- ❌ MCP auto-configuration (missing)
- ❌ Usage analytics (missing)
- ❌ Runtime introspection (missing)

## 🏗️ Solution: 6 New Generators

Extending `claude-nixos-automation` following the existing architecture (BaseGenerator + Jinja2 + Pydantic):

### Phase 1: Permissions Generator [7-8h]
**Status**: ✅ Already planned in detail (PERMISSIONS_AUTOMATION_SESSION_HANDOFF.md)

- Auto-optimize `.claude/settings.local.json` per project
- Security-first templates (deny sensitive paths)
- Project-type detection (Python/Node.js/Rust/NixOS)
- Preserve user customizations

### Phase 2: Directory Context Generator [3-4h]
- Generate `docs/CLAUDE.md`, `modules/CLAUDE.md`, etc.
- Directory-specific guidelines and do-not-touch areas
- Automated detection of directory purpose
- Templates for common directory types

### Phase 3: Local Context Generator [2-3h]
- Generate `.claude/CLAUDE.local.md` (gitignored)
- Machine-specific: hardware specs, WIP notes, experiments
- Detect running services (Docker, PostgreSQL, etc.)
- Track current work from git branches

### Phase 4: Slash Commands Generator [4-5h]
- Create `~/.claude/commands/rebuild-check.md`, `tool-info.md`, etc.
- Analyze git history for common workflows
- Natural language commands with `$ARGUMENTS` support
- 10-15 commands auto-generated from usage patterns

### Phase 5: MCP Config Generator [5-6h]
- Auto-configure `~/.claude.json` MCP servers
- Detect available servers (filesystem, git, custom)
- Project-type specific configurations
- Preserve user customizations
- **Bonus**: Custom NixOS introspection MCP (systemctl, nixos-version, journal logs)

### Phase 6: Usage Analytics Generator [6-7h]
- Parse shell history (Fish) for actual tool usage
- Generate "Frequently Used" section in system CLAUDE.md
- Prioritize top 20 tools (90% of usage)
- Privacy-first (local-only, opt-out available)
- Weekly async updates

## 📈 Expected Impact

### Quantitative Improvements
| Metric | Before | After | Change |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| Best practices coverage | 2/8 (25%) | 8/8 (100%) | +75% |
| Token usage per session | ~25KB | ~15KB | -40% |
| Manual maintenance | Weekly | Zero | -100% |
| Context files | 2 | 10-15 | +5-7x |
| Custom commands | 0 | 10-15 | New |
| MCP servers | 2 (manual) | 4-6 (auto) | +2-4 |

### Qualitative Improvements
- ✅ Claude knows about running services (not just installed packages)
- ✅ Machine-specific context (hardware, experiments, WIP)
- ✅ Directory-level guidelines (what to touch, what not to touch)
- ✅ Workflow shortcuts (custom slash commands)
- ✅ Optimized recommendations (based on actual usage)
- ✅ Live system introspection (runtime state, not just config)

## 🚀 Implementation Timeline

**Total**: ~30 hours across 6 phases

| Phase | Hours | Priority | Status |
|-------|-------|----------|--------|
| 1. Permissions | 7-8h | 🔴 Critical (foundation) | ✅ Planned |
| 2. Directory Context | 3-4h | 🟡 High (quick win) | 📋 Roadmap |
| 3. Local Context | 2-3h | 🟡 High (quick win) | 📋 Roadmap |
| 4. Slash Commands | 4-5h | 🟢 Medium (high impact) | 📋 Roadmap |
| 5. MCP Config | 5-6h | 🟢 Medium | 📋 Roadmap |
| 6. Usage Analytics | 6-7h | 🔵 Low (long-term value) | 📋 Roadmap |

**Recommended approach**: Implement sequentially, test each phase on real projects before proceeding.

**Completion estimate**: 2-3 weeks of focused development

## 📋 Key Design Decisions

### 1. Follow Existing Pattern
- Extends `BaseGenerator` (same as SystemGenerator, ProjectGenerator)
- Uses Jinja2 templates in `templates/` directory
- Returns `GenerationResult` with backup system
- Pydantic schemas for validation

### 2. No TDD Enforcement
- Infrastructure code (follows existing project style)
- Manual testing checklist per phase
- Test on real projects (ai-project-orchestration, nixos-config, whisper-dictation)

### 3. User Control Preserved
- Markers: `_user_customized: true` prevents auto-overwrite
- Backups: All changes saved to `.backups/`
- Opt-out: Environment variables (e.g., `CLAUDE_AUTOMATION_ANALYTICS=false`)

### 4. Security First
- Permissions templates deny sensitive paths by default
- No credential storage
- Local-only processing (no cloud)
- Review prompts for new MCP servers

### 5. Privacy Respected
- Usage analytics: Local-only, no cloud transmission
- No file paths in logs
- No sensitive data collection
- Easy opt-out

## 🔄 Integration

### Updated rebuild-nixos Flow

```bash
./rebuild-nixos
  ↓
NixOS rebuild (existing)
  ↓
Phase 1: Permissions optimization       (per-project)
  ↓
Existing: System + Project CLAUDE.md
  ↓
Phase 2: Directory context              (directory-level)
  ↓
Phase 3: Local context                  (machine-specific)
  ↓
Phase 4: Slash commands                 (weekly check)
  ↓
Phase 5: MCP configuration              (auto-detect servers)
  ↓
Phase 6: Usage analytics                (weekly async)
  ↓
Done! ✅
```

**Overhead**: ~2-3 seconds per rebuild (minimal impact)

**Benefits**: Zero manual maintenance, always up-to-date

## 📚 Next Steps

### For You
1. **Review roadmap**: `~/claude-nixos-automation/COMPREHENSIVE_AUTOMATION_ROADMAP.md`
2. **Decide on timeline**: Implement all 6 phases? Or prioritize quick wins (2-3)?
3. **Approve approach**: Follow existing pattern? Any modifications needed?

### For Implementation
1. **Start Phase 1**: Permissions generator (foundation for all others)
2. **Test thoroughly**: ai-project-orchestration, nixos-config, whisper-dictation
3. **Iterate quickly**: One phase per session, get feedback
4. **Document**: Update README after each phase

### Quick Wins (If Time-Constrained)
If you want fastest impact with least effort:
1. **Phase 3** - Local context (2-3h, machine-specific notes)
2. **Phase 2** - Directory context (3-4h, better organization)
3. **Phase 4** - Slash commands (4-5h, workflow shortcuts)

**Total**: 9-12 hours for meaningful improvement

## ❓ Questions to Consider

Before starting implementation:

1. **Scope**: Implement all 6 phases or focus on quick wins (2-3)?
2. **Timeline**: 2-3 weeks for full implementation acceptable?
3. **Privacy**: Analytics opt-in or opt-out by default?
4. **Testing**: Which projects to use as test cases?
5. **MCP servers**: Want custom NixOS introspection MCP?
6. **Slash commands**: Any specific workflows to prioritize?

---

## 🎯 Recommendation

**Start with Phase 1** (Permissions) as it's already well-planned and forms the foundation. Then add quick wins:
- Phase 3 (Local context) - 2-3 hours
- Phase 2 (Directory context) - 3-4 hours

This gives you:
- ✅ Optimized permissions (security + usability)
- ✅ Machine-specific context (hardware, WIP)
- ✅ Better organization (directory guidelines)

**Total time**: ~12-15 hours for meaningful improvement

**Then**: Evaluate impact, decide if Phases 4-6 worth the additional 15-18 hours.

**The automatic CLAUDE.md update is excellent**, but this plan makes it **exceptional** by covering all best practices with zero manual effort.
