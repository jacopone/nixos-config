# CI/CD Quick Start (5 Minutes)

## What Just Happened

A complete CI/CD & DevOps assessment and implementation package has been generated:

### Files Created

**Assessment & Planning**:
- `docs/CICD_DEVOPS_ASSESSMENT.md` - 650+ line comprehensive analysis
- `docs/CICD_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` - Step-by-step implementation
- `docs/CICD_QUICK_START.md` - This file

**GitHub Actions Workflows** (ready to use):
- `.github/workflows/validate-pr.yml` - PR validation (syntax, security, docs)
- `.github/workflows/deploy-main.yml` - Deployment preparation
- `.github/workflows/security-scan.yml` - Daily security scanning
- `.github/workflows/performance-bench.yml` - Weekly performance tracking
- `.github/workflows/update-dependencies.yml` - Weekly dependency updates

### Current Status

**Automation Maturity**: Level 3/5 (Managed)
- ✅ Manual automation: rebuild-nixos (651 lines, 14 phases)
- ✅ Quality checks: Available but manual
- ✅ Git hooks: Documentation policy enforcement
- ❌ CI/CD pipeline: Not yet active
- ❌ Automated deployment: Requires manual trigger

---

## Get Started Now (Choose Your Path)

### Path A: Minimal Setup (30 minutes)

Just enable branch protection to prevent broken merges:

```bash
# 1. Go to GitHub Settings
# https://github.com/jacopone/nixos-config/settings/branches

# 2. Add rule for "master"
# - Require PR before merging
# - Require status checks to pass (once workflows run)

# Done! Branch is now protected.
```

**Benefit**: Prevents broken code from merging
**Effort**: 30 minutes
**Next**: Implement Phase 1 later

---

### Path B: Phase 1 Complete Setup (10-14 hours)

Implement full foundational CI/CD:

```bash
# 1. Enable workflows (they're already created!)
git push origin master
# GitHub automatically detects .github/workflows/

# 2. Enable branch protection (same as Path A)

# 3. Set up secrets (4-6 hours)
# See: docs/CICD_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md → Step 1d

# 4. Test the pipeline (2-3 hours)
# Create a test PR and watch it validate

# Done! Full CI/CD pipeline is active.
```

**Benefit**: Automated quality gates, security scanning, deployment prep
**Effort**: 10-14 hours (spread over 1-2 weeks)
**Next**: Monitor for 1 week, then Phase 2

---

### Path C: Review First (No Implementation Yet)

Read and understand before implementing:

1. **Full Assessment** (30 min read)
   - `docs/CICD_DEVOPS_ASSESSMENT.md`
   - Current state, gaps, recommendations
   - Technology choices explained

2. **Implementation Guide** (15 min read)
   - `docs/CICD_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`
   - Step-by-step instructions
   - Troubleshooting guide

3. **Then decide**: Path A or Path B

---

## What Each Workflow Does

### validate-pr.yml (Runs on every PR)
- ✅ Nix syntax validation (`nix flake check`)
- ✅ Secret detection (gitleaks)
- ✅ Documentation quality (markdown lint)
- ✅ Comments status on PR
- **Duration**: ~5-10 min
- **Blocks merge if**: Syntax errors (hard fail)

### security-scan.yml (Runs daily at 2 AM UTC)
- ✅ Secret detection (gitleaks)
- ✅ Vulnerability scanning (Trivy)
- ✅ License checking
- ✅ SBOM generation
- **Duration**: ~15 min
- **Alerts if**: Vulnerabilities found

### performance-bench.yml (Runs weekly)
- ✅ Flake evaluation time (baseline: 11.9s)
- ✅ Build time (baseline: ~60-90s)
- ✅ Closure size (baseline: 18.4GB)
- **Duration**: ~20 min
- **Warns if**: Regression >50%

### deploy-main.yml (Runs on every master push)
- ✅ Pre-deployment validation
- ✅ Build configuration
- ✅ Notify deployment ready
- **Manual approval**: Required for SSH deployment
- **Duration**: ~10-15 min

### update-dependencies.yml (Runs weekly)
- ✅ Update flake inputs
- ✅ Validate changes
- ✅ Create PR with updates
- **Review**: Required before merge
- **Duration**: ~10 min

## 30-Second Decision Framework

### Choose Path A if:
- You want minimal effort, maximum safety
- You have limited time this week
- You trust the rebuild-nixos process

### Choose Path B if:
- You want professional-grade CI/CD
- You can dedicate 10-14 hours over 1-2 weeks
- You want continuous monitoring and automated gates

### Choose Path C if:
- You want to understand before implementing
- You're concerned about security implications
- You want to customize workflows

## Key Files to Review

### For Quick Understanding (15 min)
1. This file (CICD_QUICK_START.md)
2. Assessment executive summary (CICD_DEVOPS_ASSESSMENT.md - first 100 lines)

### For Implementation (1-2 hours)
1. CICD_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md (Phase 1 only)
2. Individual workflow files (.github/workflows/*)

### For Deep Dive (3-4 hours)
1. Full CICD_DEVOPS_ASSESSMENT.md
2. All workflow files
3. Current rebuild-nixos script

---

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Are the workflows safe?**
A: Yes. All workflows follow GitHub security best practices:
- No dangerous command injection patterns
- Untrusted input handled via environment variables
- Secrets not logged or printed
- Minimal permissions requested

**Q: Do I need to change rebuild-nixos?**
A: No. The workflows complement it, they don't replace it. The existing rebuild-nixos script remains as-is.

**Q: What if something breaks?**
A: Branch protection prevents broken code from merging. If it slips through:
1. Use existing rollback: `sudo nixos-rebuild switch --rollback`
2. Fix the code
3. Push fix to new PR
4. Merge after validation passes

**Q: Can I skip Phase 1?**
A: You could, but branch protection (Path A) is highly recommended. It prevents most issues.

**Q: How much does this cost?**
A: Free. GitHub provides 2,000 free Actions minutes/month. This system uses ~160 min/month.

**Q: Can I customize the workflows?**
A: Yes. The workflows are plain YAML - edit them however you want. See the assessment for guidance.
