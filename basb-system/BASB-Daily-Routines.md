## üìä ROUTINE OPTIMIZATION TRACKING

### **Daily Metrics (Track in Dashboard):**
- **Morning routine completion time:** Target <15 minutes
- **Inbox items processed:** Keep, Gmail, Drive updates
- **BASB insights ‚Üí Sunsama tasks:** Target 2-3 conversions
- **Evening captures made:** Ideas, insights, articles saved

### **Weekly Metrics:**
- **Routine consistency:** Days completed out of 7
- **Knowledge ‚Üí action conversion rate:** Tasks completed vs planned
- **TFP coverage:** Which problems got attention this week
- **System friction points:** What slowed down the workflow

### **Monthly Optimization:**
- **Routine timing adjustments** based on actual completion times
- **Template refinements** based on usage patterns
- **Integration improvements** between platforms
- **Automation opportunities** identified

---

## üîß ROUTINE TROUBLESHOOTING

### **Common Issues & Solutions:**

**"Morning routine taking too long"**
- Solution: Set strict time limits, use voice notes instead of typing
- Focus on triage, not perfection - refine during weekly review

**"Evening captures too brief/shallow"**
- Solution: Use voice memos during the day, transcribe in evening
- Set specific TFP focus for each day to guide capture

**"Forgetting to do routines"**
- Solution: Set phone alarms, link to existing habits (coffee, commute)
- Start with just 3 days/week, build consistency gradually

**"Not generating enough actionable tasks"**
- Solution: Focus on TFP-relevant captures, be more selective
- Review examples above for task generation patterns

### **Optimization Tips:**
- **Batch similar activities** (all email processing together)
- **Use voice input** for faster mobile capture
- **Create shortcuts** for common BASB tag combinations
- **Link routines to habits** (morning coffee, evening shutdown)
