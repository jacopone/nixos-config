## üìã MIGRATION DECISION MATRIX

### **For Each Piece of Content, Evaluate:**

**1. TFP Relevance Score (1-5)**
- 5: Directly supports multiple TFPs
- 4: Strongly supports 1 TFP
- 3: Moderately supports 1 TFP
- 2: Loosely connected to TFPs
- 1: No clear TFP connection

**2. Actionability Score (1-5)**

## üöÄ MIGRATION WORKFLOW

### **Phase 1: High-Impact Quick Wins (2 hours)**

**Target:** Content scoring 15-20 that can be moved quickly

**Workflow:**
1. **Scan existing folders** for obvious high-value items
2. **Apply scoring matrix** quickly (30 seconds per item)
3. **Move Priority 1 items** to appropriate BASB folders:
   ```
   Old: "AI Research/GPT-4 experiments"
   New: "01_PROJECTS/P1-TEC_AI-Agents-System/research/"

   Old: "Health/Sleep optimization study"
   New: "02_AREAS/A1-HLT_Health-Wellness/research/"

   Old: "Finance/Investment analysis 2024"
   New: "02_AREAS/A1-FIN_Personal-Finance/analysis/"
   ```
4. **Apply progressive summarization** (Layer 1) during move
5. **Tag with relevant TFPs** and action levels

### **Phase 2: Structured Deep Migration (3 hours over 1 week)**

**Session 1: Project-Related Content (1 hour)**
- Focus on P1/P2 project folders
- Migrate active project documentation
- Update with current BASB taxonomy
- Link to Sunsama project progress

**Session 2: Area Maintenance Content (1 hour)**
- Focus on A1 critical areas (Health, Finance, Work, Family)
- Migrate ongoing reference materials
- Organize by frequency of access
- Connect to daily/weekly routines

**Session 3: Learning Resources (1 hour)**
- Focus on R2/R3 resource folders
- Migrate high-value educational content
- Apply progressive summarization where possible
- Tag with learning goals and TFP connections

## üîß MIGRATION TROUBLESHOOTING

### **Common Challenges:**

**"Too much content to migrate"**
- Solution: Focus on TFP scoring, be ruthless with Priority 3 content
- Remember: Better to have less content well-organized than everything chaotic

**"Hard to decide where content belongs"**
- Solution: Use the 3-question matrix from file processing workflow
- When in doubt, choose based on highest TFP relevance

**"Content doesn't fit BASB categories cleanly"**
- Solution: Use GEN domain for misc content, create subcategories as needed
- Consider if content is truly valuable or just familiar

**"Migration taking too long"**
- Solution: Time-box sessions strictly, focus on high-impact items first
- Use batch processing for similar content types
