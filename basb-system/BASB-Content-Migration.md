## 📋 MIGRATION DECISION MATRIX

### **For Each Piece of Content, Evaluate:**

**1. TFP Relevance Score (1-5)**
- 5: Directly supports multiple TFPs
- 4: Strongly supports 1 TFP
- 3: Moderately supports 1 TFP
- 2: Loosely connected to TFPs
- 1: No clear TFP connection

**2. Actionability Score (1-5)**
- 5: Immediately actionable with clear next steps
- 4: Actionable with minor adaptation
- 3: Provides useful reference for future action
- 2: Interesting but not directly actionable
- 1: Purely informational, no action potential

**3. Uniqueness Score (1-5)**
- 5: Irreplaceable, custom content you created
- 4: Hard to find elsewhere, valuable source
- 3: Available elsewhere but curated/annotated
- 2: Easily replaceable, common information
- 1: Readily available online, generic content

**Migration Priority = (TFP Relevance × 2) + Actionability + Uniqueness**

**Migration Thresholds:**
- **Score 15-20:** Migrate immediately (Priority 1)
- **Score 10-14:** Migrate soon (Priority 2)

## 🚀 MIGRATION WORKFLOW

### **Phase 1: High-Impact Quick Wins (2 hours)**

**Target:** Content scoring 15-20 that can be moved quickly

**Workflow:**
1. **Scan existing folders** for obvious high-value items
2. **Apply scoring matrix** quickly (30 seconds per item)
3. **Move Priority 1 items** to appropriate BASB folders:
   ```
   Old: "AI Research/GPT-4 experiments"
   New: "01_PROJECTS/P1-TEC_AI-Agents-System/research/"

   Old: "Health/Sleep optimization study"
   New: "02_AREAS/A1-HLT_Health-Wellness/research/"

   Old: "Finance/Investment analysis 2024"
   New: "02_AREAS/A1-FIN_Personal-Finance/analysis/"
   ```
4. **Apply progressive summarization** (Layer 1) during move
5. **Tag with relevant TFPs** and action levels

### **Phase 2: Structured Deep Migration (3 hours over 1 week)**

**Session 1: Project-Related Content (1 hour)**
- Focus on P1/P2 project folders
- Migrate active project documentation
- Update with current BASB taxonomy
- Link to Sunsama project progress

**Session 2: Area Maintenance Content (1 hour)**
- Focus on A1 critical areas (Health, Finance, Work, Family)
- Migrate ongoing reference materials
- Organize by frequency of access
- Connect to daily/weekly routines

**Session 3: Learning Resources (1 hour)**
- Focus on R2/R3 resource folders
- Migrate high-value educational content
- Apply progressive summarization where possible
- Tag with learning goals and TFP connections

## 📁 FOLDER-SPECIFIC MIGRATION STRATEGIES

### **From: "040_Progetti_R&D" → To: "P1-RES_Research-Projects/"**

**Migration Steps:**
1. **Review all subfolders** for active research
2. **Separate active from completed** projects
3. **Move active research** to P1-RES with full documentation
4. **Archive completed research** to X2-RES with summaries
5. **Extract actionable insights** for immediate Sunsama tasks

**Expected Outcome:** 3-5 active research threads properly documented

### **From: "050_CodingAgentsSystem" → To: "P1-TEC_AI-Agents-System/"**

**Migration Steps:**
1. **Organize by development phase** (research, architecture, implementation)
2. **Create comprehensive documentation** linking code to concepts
3. **Connect to TFP1** (AI creativity) explicitly
4. **Generate current project status** summary
5. **Plan integration** with local codebase (for Phase 3)

**Expected Outcome:** Fully documented AI project with clear next steps

### **From: "01_Famiglia" → To: "A1-FAM_Family-Life/"**

**Migration Steps:**
1. **Separate active family planning** from memories/archives
2. **Organize by responsibility areas** (household, relationships, personal)
3. **Extract recurring tasks** for routine templates
4. **Connect to TFP4** (professional growth) and TFP6 (sustainability)
5. **Link to calendar** and family coordination systems

**Expected Outcome:** Organized family management system

### **From: "03_Content_to_be_consumed" → To: "R2-LRN_Learning-Pipeline/"**

**Migration Steps:**

## 🔧 MIGRATION TROUBLESHOOTING

### **Common Challenges:**

**"Too much content to migrate"**
- Solution: Focus on TFP scoring, be ruthless with Priority 3 content
- Remember: Better to have less content well-organized than everything chaotic

**"Hard to decide where content belongs"**
- Solution: Use the 3-question matrix from file processing workflow
- When in doubt, choose based on highest TFP relevance

**"Content doesn't fit BASB categories cleanly"**
- Solution: Use GEN domain for misc content, create subcategories as needed
- Consider if content is truly valuable or just familiar

**"Migration taking too long"**
- Solution: Time-box sessions strictly, focus on high-impact items first
- Use batch processing for similar content types
