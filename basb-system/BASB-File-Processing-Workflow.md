# BASB File Processing Workflow
**Phase 2: Cleaning Up Existing Files**

---

## üéØ OBJECTIVE
Transform your existing messy files into organized BASB structure using systematic decision-making.

---

## üîç 3-QUESTION DECISION MATRIX

**For each loose file, ask these questions in order:**

### **Question 1: When did I last use this?**
- **Last 3 months** ‚Üí Keep in active PARA category (Projects/Areas)
- **3-12 months ago** ‚Üí Consider for Resources or Archive
- **1+ years ago** ‚Üí Strong candidate for deletion

### **Question 2: Will I need this for current projects or TFPs?**
- **Yes, actively** ‚Üí Projects (P1/P2/P3)
- **Maybe for reference** ‚Üí Resources (R2/R3)
- **Relates to ongoing responsibility** ‚Üí Areas (A1/A2/A3)
- **No clear connection** ‚Üí Archive (X3) or delete

### **Question 3: What's the cost of losing it?**
- **High** (legal, financial, irreplaceable) ‚Üí Keep in A1/A2
- **Medium** (useful reference, hard to find again) ‚Üí Resources R2/R3
- **Low** (easily replaceable, available online) ‚Üí Delete or X3

## üìã PROCESSING EXAMPLES

### **‚úÖ KEEP - Examples:**

**Colab Notebooks** ‚Üí `R2-TEC_Code-Notebooks/`
- Last used: 6 months ago
- Needed for: Current AI projects (TFP1)
- Cost of losing: Medium (custom code, experiments)

**Health Simulation** ‚Üí `R2-HLT_Health-Research/`
- Last used: 4 months ago
- Needed for: Health optimization (TFP2)
- Cost of losing: Medium (research value)

**Meet Recordings** ‚Üí `R3-WRK_Meeting-Archive/`
- Last used: 8 months ago
- Needed for: Occasional reference
- Cost of losing: Low-Medium (context for decisions)

**Bank Statements** ‚Üí `A1-FIN_Personal-Finance/`
- Last used: 2 months ago
- Needed for: Tax preparation, financial tracking (TFP3)
- Cost of losing: High (legal/financial importance)

### **üóëÔ∏è DELETE - Examples:**

**Chromebook Wallpaper** ‚Üí DELETE
- Last used: 1+ years ago
- Needed for: No current use
- Cost of losing: Very low (easily replaceable)

**Random Screenshots** ‚Üí DELETE
- Last used: Unknown/never
- Needed for: No clear purpose
- Cost of losing: Very low (likely duplicates or outdated)

### **üì¶ ARCHIVE - Examples:**

**System Backups (backup-11092024)** ‚Üí `X3-GEN_System-Backups/`
- Last used: At creation only
- Needed for: Emergency restore only
- Cost of losing: Medium (safety net, but low frequency use)

## ‚ö° QUICK SORTING WORKFLOW

### **Phase 1: Rapid Triage (5 minutes per folder)**
1. **Open folder** in GNOME Files
2. **Sort by "Date Modified"** (most recent first)
3. **Quick scan** - identify obvious deletes first
4. **Move obvious keepers** to appropriate BASB folders
5. **Flag uncertain items** for detailed review

### **Phase 2: Detailed Review (2-3 minutes per uncertain file)**
1. **Open/preview file** to understand content
2. **Apply 3-question matrix** systematically
3. **Check TFP relevance** - does it connect to your 8 favorite problems?
4. **Make decision** and move immediately
5. **No "maybe" pile** - force a decision

### **Phase 3: Final Cleanup (1 minute per processed folder)**
1. **Delete empty folders**
2. **Verify BASB naming** conventions applied
3. **Update personal dashboard** with progress
4. **Note any patterns** for future file management

---

## üéØ TFP-BASED PRIORITIZATION

**Process files in this order based on TFP relevance:**

### **High TFP Value (Process First)**
- **AI/Tech content** ‚Üí TFP1 (AI creativity), TFP7 (info organization)
- **Health documents** ‚Üí TFP2 (health optimization)
- **Financial records** ‚Üí TFP3 (financial systems)
- **Learning materials** ‚Üí TFP5 (learning to action)
- **Art/Creative files** ‚Üí TFP8 (artistic skills)

### **Medium TFP Value (Process Second)**
- **Work/Career content** ‚Üí TFP4 (professional growth)
- **Sustainability resources** ‚Üí TFP6 (sustainable living)
- **General organization** ‚Üí TFP7 (information retrieval)

### **Low TFP Value (Process Last)**
- **Random/misc files** with no clear TFP connection
- **Legacy content** from old projects
- **Duplicate or outdated materials**

---

## üìä PROCESSING TRACKING TEMPLATE

**Copy this to your dashboard for each folder processed:**

```
FOLDER: [FOLDER NAME]
FILES PROCESSED: [COUNT]
DECISIONS:
  ‚úÖ Kept & Organized: [COUNT]
  üóëÔ∏è Deleted: [COUNT]
  üì¶ Archived: [COUNT]

TFP CONNECTIONS FOUND: [COUNT]
TIME SPENT: [MINUTES]
INSIGHTS/PATTERNS: [NOTES]

NEXT FOLDER: [NAME]
```

## üöÄ BATCH PROCESSING STRATEGY

### **Session 1: Quick Wins (45 minutes)**
Target: Obviously deletable content
- Old screenshots, wallpapers, temp files
- Duplicate downloads, old installers
- Empty or nearly-empty folders

### **Session 2: High-Value Content (60 minutes)**
Target: TFP-relevant files
- Tech/AI content ‚Üí TEC domain
- Health documents ‚Üí HLT domain
- Financial records ‚Üí FIN domain

### **Session 3: Work Content (45 minutes)**
Target: Professional materials
- Meeting recordings, work documents
- Project files, presentations
- Career development materials

### **Session 4: Personal Content (45 minutes)**
Target: Family, creative, misc
- Family photos/documents ‚Üí FAM domain
- Creative projects ‚Üí ART domain
- General admin ‚Üí GEN domain

### **Session 5: Final Cleanup (30 minutes)**
Target: Remaining uncertain items
- Apply strict deletion criteria
- Force decisions on borderline cases
- Complete folder organization

---

## ‚úÖ SUCCESS CRITERIA

**Phase 2 completion indicators:**
- [ ] **80% of loose files** properly categorized using BASB taxonomy
- [ ] **All high-TFP-value content** moved to appropriate folders
- [ ] **Obvious low-value content** deleted
- [ ] **BASB folder structure** consistently applied
- [ ] **Dashboard tracking** shows processing progress
- [ ] **Cross-platform alignment** maintained (Gmail, Keep consistent with Drive)

---

## üîß PRACTICAL TIPS

### **Decision Fatigue Prevention**
- **Time-box sessions** - max 60 minutes at a time
- **Start with easy decisions** - build momentum with obvious deletes
- **Use the 2-minute rule** - if you can't decide in 2 minutes, it's probably not important
- **Batch similar content** - process all photos together, all documents together

### **When Stuck on a Decision**
- **Ask: "If I needed this, where would I logically look for it?"**
- **Consider: "What would happen if I delete this and need it later?"**
- **Remember: "Keeping everything is the same as organizing nothing"**

### **Maintaining Momentum**
- **Celebrate progress** - update dashboard after each session
- **Focus on high-impact folders** first
- **Don't aim for perfection** - aim for functional organization
- **Review and adjust** taxonomy as you go
