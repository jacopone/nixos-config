## 📋 KNOWLEDGE → ACTION PIPELINE

### **Daily Knowledge Integration (Morning Routine):**

**Step 1: BASB Review (5 minutes)**
1. **Check Google Keep** #now and #soon tags
2. **Review Drive project folders** for new insights
3. **Scan Readwise** ready-for-action items
4. **Note any TFP connections** from yesterday's learning

**Step 2: Sunsama Task Generation (10 minutes)**
1. **Convert BASB insights** into specific Sunsama tasks
2. **Assign to appropriate projects/areas**
3. **Set realistic time estimates**
4. **Add context notes** linking back to BASB source

**Step 3: Daily Planning (15 minutes)**
1. **Use Sunsama planning** with BASB context
2. **Reference project folders** for current priorities
3. **Schedule knowledge work** (research, summarization)
4. **Balance action with learning**

### **Task Generation Examples:**

**From Readwise Article:**
```
BASB Source: Article tagged #tfp1-ai-creativity #actionable-now
"Memory architectures for autonomous agents"

Sunsama Tasks Generated:
□ Research agent memory patterns (30 min) - AI Agents project
□ Test memory implementation in current codebase (1 hour)
□ Update architecture docs with memory design (15 min)
```

**From Google Keep Note:**
```
BASB Source: Keep note #p1-tec #tfp1 #now
"Voice memo: API integration idea for accounting project"

Sunsama Tasks Generated:
□ Review accounting API documentation (45 min) - AI Business project
□ Prototype integration approach (1.5 hours)
□ Schedule client demo for next week (5 min)
```

**From Drive Folder Review:**
```
BASB Source: A1-HLT_Health-Wellness/new-research.md
Layer 3 summary on circadian optimization

Sunsama Tasks Generated:
□ Implement new sleep schedule this week (Health area)
□ Track sleep quality metrics (5 min daily)
□ Research blue light filtering tools (20 min)
```

## 📊 WEEKLY REVIEW INTEGRATION

### **Sunday BASB + Sunsama Review (45 minutes):**

**Phase 1: Knowledge Review (15 minutes)**
1. **Review week's captures** across all BASB platforms
2. **Process Layer 2-3** progressive summarization pipeline
3. **Identify high-value insights** for next week's action
4. **Update TFP tracking** - which problems got attention?

**Phase 2: Project Alignment (15 minutes)**
1. **Review Sunsama project progress** vs BASB project folders
2. **Update Drive documentation** with week's accomplishments
3. **Sync project status** across both systems
4. **Note any project priority changes**

**Phase 3: Next Week Planning (15 minutes)**
1. **Generate next week's knowledge priorities** from BASB
2. **Create Sunsama tasks** for high-impact learning
3. **Schedule deep work blocks** for Layer 3-4 processing
4. **Set knowledge → action conversion goals**

## 🎯 TFP-DRIVEN TASK PRIORITIZATION

### **Task Scoring System:**
**High Priority (Schedule First):**
- Direct TFP connection + actionable insight
- Supports P1 project with clear deadline
- Builds on recent Layer 3-4 summaries

**Medium Priority (Fill Time Blocks):**
- Indirect TFP connection
- Supports A1 areas or P2 projects
- Advances knowledge pipeline

**Low Priority (Optional/Someday):**
- No clear TFP connection
- Purely exploratory or maintenance
- Can be deferred without impact

### **Daily TFP Focus Rotation:**
```
Monday: TFP1 (AI Creativity) + TFP4 (Professional Growth)
Tuesday: TFP2 (Health) + TFP5 (Learning to Action)
Wednesday: TFP3 (Finance) + TFP7 (Info Organization)
Thursday: TFP8 (Artistic Skills) + TFP6 (Sustainability)
Friday: TFP Review + Cross-connections
Weekend: TFP Integration + Planning
```
