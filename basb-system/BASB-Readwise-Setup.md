---

## 🎯 OBJECTIVE
Integrate Readwise Reader with your BASB system for seamless article processing and progressive summarization.

---

## 🏷️ READWISE TAGGING SYSTEM

### **PARA Alignment Tags**
Map your BASB categories to readable Readwise tags:

```
📋 PROJECT TAGS:

```

### **TFP Integration Tags**
Connect articles directly to your 8 Favorite Problems:

```
🎯 TFP TAGS:
tfp1-ai-creativity        → How can I build AI systems that amplify human creativity?

### **Progressive Summarization Status Tags**
Track your processing progress:

```
📖 PROCESSING STATUS:
layer1-captured           → Initial save with key excerpts
layer2-bolded            → Main points identified and bolded
layer3-highlighted       → Key insights highlighted in yellow
layer4-summary           → Executive summary created
ready-for-action         → Actionable insights identified
needs-review             → Requires re-reading or deeper analysis
```

### **Actionability Level Tags**
Determine next steps for each article:

```
⚡ ACTION LEVEL:
actionable-now           → Can implement immediately
actionable-soon          → Within next 2 weeks
actionable-someday       → Future reference/inspiration

## 🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING

### **Common Issues:**
- **Too many saves, not enough processing** → Be more selective in captures
- **Tags getting inconsistent** → Use this reference guide religiously
- **No actionable insights** → Focus on TFP-relevant content
- **Overwhelming backlog** → Set weekly processing limits

### **Optimization Tips:**
- **Start with TFP-relevant articles** only
- **Focus on quality over quantity** of captures
- **Use progressive summarization gradually** - don't force Layer 4
- **Connect insights to current projects** for immediate value
