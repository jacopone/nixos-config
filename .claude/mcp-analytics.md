### Session Utilization

**Total sessions analyzed**: 420

This section shows how efficiently each MCP server uses context tokens across sessions. Global servers load in ALL sessions (consuming overhead tokens), even when not used.

#### playwright (global scope)

**Session Metrics:**
- Utilization rate: 4.3% (18/420 sessions)
- Efficiency: POOR
- ⚠️  Loads in ALL sessions (420 sessions)

**Overhead Analysis:**
- Estimated overhead: ~4,000 tokens per session
- Total wasted overhead: ~1,608,000 tokens (402 unused sessions)
- 🔴 **Action needed**: Consider moving to project-level config to reduce waste
