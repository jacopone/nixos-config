**Unique Features:**
- **MCP Serena Optimization**: Explicit guidance to prefer symbolic tools over full file reads for token efficiency
- **Quality Gate Examples**: Concrete before/after code examples for each quality threshold
- **Token Efficiency**: Instructions to use symbolic tools (get_symbols_overview, find_symbol) before reading entire files
- **DevEnv Awareness**: Complete understanding of available scripts (quality-check, quality-report, setup-*)

### 2. `.claude/settings.local.json` (Enhanced Configuration)

**Purpose**: Claude Code settings with quality hooks and MCP integration.

**Configuration:**
```json
{
  "$schema": "https://json.schemastore.org/claude-code-settings.json",
  "permissions": {
    "allow": ["*"],
    "defaultMode": "default"
  },
  "enableAllProjectMcpServers": true,
  "env": {
    "CLAUDE_QUALITY_MODE": "enterprise",
    "CLAUDE_COMPLEXITY_TARGET": "8",
    "CLAUDE_MIN_COVERAGE": "75"
  },
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Write|Edit",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "echo '🔍 Quality Gate: Ensure CCN < 10, duplication < 5%, no secrets'"
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Write|Edit",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "echo '✅ File modified - run quality-check before committing'"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  "includeCoAuthoredBy": true
}
```

**Features:**
- **Quality Hooks**: Automatic reminders before/after Write and Edit operations
- **Environment Variables**: Quality mode indicators for Claude to reference
- **MCP Auto-Enable**: Automatically approve project MCP servers (like Serena)
- **Co-Authoring**: Include Claude attribution in commits and PRs

### 3. `setup-claude` Script (DevEnv Integration)

**Purpose**: One-command setup for Claude Code integration.

**What it does:**
1. Creates `.claude/` directory
2. Copies `CLAUDE.md` configuration from template
3. Copies `settings.local.json` from template
4. Creates `.claudeignore` with build artifacts, dependencies, and IDE configs

**Usage:**
```bash
devenv shell          # Enter development environment
setup-claude          # Run setup
```

**Output:**
```

## Architecture Comparison

### Cursor AI Approach
```
.cursor/
├── rules/
│   ├── index.mdc       # Core development rules
│   ├── security.mdc    # Security patterns
│   └── testing.mdc     # Testing standards
└── .cursorignore       # Context exclusions
```

**Characteristics:**
- Multiple MDC files with YAML frontmatter
- Glob patterns for file targeting
- `alwaysApply` flags for rule activation
- YOLO mode for advanced capabilities
- Agent mode keyboard shortcuts

### Claude Code Approach (October 2025)
```
.claude/
├── CLAUDE.md                  # Single comprehensive instruction file
├── settings.local.json        # Hooks, permissions, MCP config
└── .claudeignore             # Context exclusions
```

**Characteristics:**
- Single comprehensive Markdown instruction file
- MCP server integration (Serena for symbolic operations)
- Pre/Post tool use hooks for quality reminders
- Environment variables for quality mode
- JSON Schema validated settings

## Key Differentiators

### Claude Code Advantages

**1. Token Efficiency via MCP Serena**
```markdown
### MCP Server Integration
**Serena MCP Server (Available):**
ALWAYS prefer Serena tools over file-level operations for code understanding:

- Use `mcp__serena__get_symbols_overview` before reading entire files
- Use `mcp__serena__find_symbol` for targeted code discovery
- Use `mcp__serena__replace_symbol_body` for surgical code changes
```

**Impact**: Claude uses symbolic tools to read function-level symbols instead of entire files, reducing token usage by 60-80% for code exploration tasks.

**2. Comprehensive Quality Gate Guidance**
```markdown
#### Cyclomatic Complexity (Enforced: CCN < 10)
- **Every function** must have McCabe complexity < 10
- **Lizard runs automatically** on commit via git hook
- **Commit will fail** if any function exceeds CCN 10

**Example - Before (CCN 15, FAILS):**
[10 lines of nested conditionals]

**Example - After (CCN 3, PASSES):**
[Refactored with extracted helpers]
```

**Impact**: Claude understands not just the threshold, but *how* to refactor complex code to pass quality gates, with concrete examples.

**3. DevEnv Context Awareness**
```markdown
### Available Development Scripts
- `quality-report` - Show all active quality gates
- `quality-check` - Run comprehensive quality analysis
- `setup-git-hooks` - Install git hooks manually
```

**Impact**: Claude knows about all available scripts and can suggest running them at appropriate times.

**4. Quality Hooks**
```json
"hooks": {
  "PreToolUse": [
    {
      "matcher": "Write|Edit",
      "hooks": [
        {
          "type": "command",
          "command": "echo '🔍 Quality Gate: Ensure CCN < 10, duplication < 5%, no secrets'"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Impact**: Claude receives automatic reminders about quality thresholds before every Write/Edit operation.

### Cursor AI Advantages

**1. Multi-File Rule Organization**
- Separate files for different concerns (security, testing, core development)
- Glob patterns for targeting specific file types
- `alwaysApply` flags for selective rule activation

**2. YOLO Mode**
- Advanced AI capabilities with build/test execution
- More aggressive autonomous operations

**3. Agent Mode UI**
- Integrated keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+I, Ctrl+E)
- Visual agent mode interface

## Shared Quality Standards

Both AI systems enforce **identical quality gates**:

| Quality Metric | Threshold | Tool | Enforcement |
|---------------|-----------|------|-------------|
| **Cyclomatic Complexity** | CCN < 10 | Lizard (system-wide) | Pre-commit hook |
| **Code Duplication** | < 5% | JSCPD (system-wide) | Pre-commit hook |
| **Security Patterns** | Zero violations | Semgrep | Pre-commit hook |
| **Secret Detection** | Zero secrets | Gitleaks | Pre-commit hook |
| **Code Formatting** | 100% compliance | Prettier, ESLint, Black, Ruff | Pre-commit hook |
| **Commit Format** | Conventional Commits | Commitizen | commit-msg hook |
| **Test Coverage** | 75%+ | Vitest, pytest | CI/CD |

## Usage Patterns

### Starting a New Project

```bash
# 1. Copy template
cp -r ~/nixos-config/templates/ai-quality-devenv ./my-project
cd my-project

# 2. Initialize environment
direnv allow

# 3. Setup quality gates and AI
setup-git-hooks
setup-claude          # For Claude Code
setup-cursor          # For Cursor AI (optional - can use both)

# 4. Verify setup
quality-report

# 5. Start development
npm init              # or uv init for Python
```

### Development Workflow with Claude Code

```bash
# Start Claude Code session
claude-code .

# Claude will:
# 1. Read .claude/CLAUDE.md for quality gate awareness
# 2. Use MCP Serena for symbolic code operations
# 3. Receive quality reminders on Write/Edit operations
# 4. Generate code that passes all quality gates

# Before committing
quality-check         # Run comprehensive quality analysis

# Commit (quality gates run automatically)
git add .
git commit -m "feat(auth): add JWT refresh mechanism"
```

### Token Efficiency Example

**Traditional Approach (High Token Usage):**
```
User: "Find where the authentication logic is implemented"
Claude: [Reads entire auth.ts file - 500 lines, ~2000 tokens]
```

**MCP Serena Approach (Low Token Usage):**
```
User: "Find where the authentication logic is implemented"
Claude:
  1. mcp__serena__get_symbols_overview(auth.ts) [~200 tokens]
  2. mcp__serena__find_symbol("AuthService", include_body=false) [~100 tokens]
  3. mcp__serena__find_symbol("AuthService/login", include_body=true) [~300 tokens]
     Total: ~600 tokens (70% reduction)
```

## Implementation Timeline

**Phase 1: Core Configuration ✅**
- Created `.claude/CLAUDE.md` (6KB comprehensive instructions)
- Created `.claude/settings.local.json` (hooks, permissions, MCP)
- Added `setup-claude` script to `devenv.nix`

**Phase 2: Documentation ✅**
- Updated `templates/ai-quality-devenv/README.md`
- Updated `templates/README.md`
- Created `CLAUDE_CODE_INTEGRATION.md` (this file)

**Phase 3: Testing (Recommended)**
- Test `setup-claude` script in a new project
- Verify hooks execute correctly on Write/Edit operations
- Confirm MCP Serena integration works as expected
- Test quality gate compliance in real development scenarios

## Best Practices

### For Claude Code Users

**1. Run setup-claude immediately:**
```bash
setup-claude
quality-report        # Understand active quality gates
```

**2. Leverage MCP Serena:**
```bash
# Instead of "read auth.ts"
# Say: "use symbolic tools to explore auth.ts structure, then read specific functions"
```

**3. Trust the quality hooks:**
```bash
# When you see: "🔍 Quality Gate: Ensure CCN < 10, duplication < 5%, no secrets"
# Claude is being reminded to check quality before writing code
```

**4. Run quality-check before committing:**
```bash
quality-check         # Comprehensive analysis
git commit            # Quality gates enforce automatically
```

### For Template Maintainers

**1. Keep CLAUDE.md and Cursor rules synchronized:**
- When updating quality thresholds, update both configurations
- When adding new tools, document in both systems
- Ensure examples reflect current best practices

**2. Test both AI systems:**
- Verify quality gates work identically for both
- Ensure generated code passes all thresholds
- Maintain feature parity where applicable

**3. Monitor MCP server compatibility:**
- Serena MCP server is currently available
- Future MCP servers may enhance Claude Code capabilities
- Update CLAUDE.md to reference new MCP tools as they become available

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements

**1. Dynamic Quality Thresholds:**
```json
// In settings.local.json
"env": {
  "CLAUDE_COMPLEXITY_MAX": "${read:devenv.nix:git-hooks.hooks.complexity-check.entry}",
  "CLAUDE_DUPLICATION_MAX": "${read:devenv.nix:git-hooks.hooks.jscpd.entry}"
}
```

**2. Quality Check Hook:**
```json
"hooks": {
  "UserPromptSubmit": [
    {
      "matcher": "commit|push",
      "hooks": [
        {
          "type": "command",
          "command": "quality-check"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**3. MCP Server Expansion:**
- Additional MCP servers for database schema analysis
- MCP server for dependency graph visualization
- MCP server for test coverage analysis

**4. AI Quality Gate Integration:**
```bash
# Potential future script
claude-quality-assist.exec = ''
  # Analyze git hook failure
  # Suggest refactoring strategies
  # Auto-fix simple violations
''
```
