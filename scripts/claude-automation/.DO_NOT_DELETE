⚠️ CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE - DO NOT DELETE ⚠️

This package is ACTIVE, ESSENTIAL infrastructure that auto-generates Claude Code configuration files.

Deleting this will:
- Break the rebuild-nixos script
- Remove Claude's knowledge of your system tools
- Disable automatic CLAUDE.md generation
- Require manual Claude configuration

See README.md in this directory for full details.

This is NOT legacy code.
This is NOT a duplicate folder.
This IS critical system infrastructure.
