#  * `create_text_file`: Creates/overwrites a file in the project directory.
#  * `delete_lines`: Deletes a range of lines within a file.
#  * `delete_memory`: Deletes a memory from Serena's project-specific memory store.
#  * `execute_shell_command`: Executes a shell command.
#  * `find_referencing_code_snippets`: Finds code snippets in which the symbol at the given location is referenced.

#  * `initial_instructions`: Gets the initial instructions for the current project.
#     Should only be used in settings where the system prompt cannot be set,
#     e.g. in clients you have no control over, like Claude Desktop.
#  * `insert_after_symbol`: Inserts content after the end of the definition of a given symbol.
#  * `insert_at_line`: Inserts content at a given line in a file.
#  * `insert_before_symbol`: Inserts content before the beginning of the definition of a given symbol.

  This is a NixOS configuration repository that manages a complete system setup with modular architecture.

  Key project characteristics:
  - **Architecture**: Modular NixOS configuration with flakes, home-manager, and GNOME desktop
  - **Structure**: hosts/, modules/, users/, profiles/ directories following ZaneyOS pattern
  - **Languages**: Primarily Nix configuration files (.nix), some shell scripts (.sh), Python automation
  - **Key files**: flake.nix (entry point), modules/core/packages.nix (system packages), rebuild-nixos (build script)
  - **Special features**: AI orchestration system, BASB knowledge management, Chrome extension management

  When working with this project:
  1. Use `find_symbol` for locating package definitions, functions, and configurations
  2. Pay attention to module imports and inter-dependencies
  3. For AI agents: Use `nix flake check` and `nix build` (rebuild-nixos requires sudo)
  4. Fish shell abbreviations are defined in modules/home-manager/base.nix
  5. System packages are in modules/core/packages.nix (109+ tools)

  Common tasks:
  - Adding packages: Edit modules/core/packages.nix or modules/home-manager/base.nix
  - Testing changes: Use `nix flake check` and `nix build` for AI agents, `./rebuild-nixos` for users
  - Module configuration: Check hosts/nixos/ for host-specific settings

project_name: "nixos-config"
